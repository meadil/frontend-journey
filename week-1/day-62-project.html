        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I'm a cheerful sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea in Bikini Bottom.<br>I work as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and I'm proud to say I'm the best fry cook in the ocean!<br>I love my pet snail Gary, jellyfishing with Patrick, and perfecting my Krabby Patty recipe.</p>

        <h2>My Skills</h2>

        <h3>Fry Cooking</h3>

        <p>I can flip a Krabby Patty faster than anyone!<br>Mr. Krabs says I'm employee of the month... every month.<br>I know 1,001 ways to make a Krabby Patty, and I never mess up an order (well, almost never).</p>


        <h3>Jellyfishing</h3>

        <p>Patrick and I go jellyfishing almost every day at Jellyfish Fields.<br>I've caught jellies of all types and sizes.<br>My net technique is unmatched, and I even know how to communicate with them!</p>


        <h3>Bubble Blowing</h3>

        <p>It's all in the technique!<br>First, go like this. Then, spin around. Stop!<br>Double take three times. And here comes the best part... POOF!<br>A perfect bubble elephant, or boat, or whatever shape I'm feeling that day.</p>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>

        <p>My biggest dream is to get my boating license from Mrs. Puff's Boating School.<br>I've failed the test 1,258,056 times, but I'm not giving up!<br>I also want to keep making people happy with my Krabby Patties and maybe become manager of the Krusty Krab someday.<br>And of course, keep being the best friend Patrick could ever have!</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>

        <p>You can find me at the Krusty Krab from 8 AM to 5 PM, or at my pineapple house at 124 Conch Street.<br>Feel free to stop by! Just don't bring any bubble bass... he's the worst.</p>
