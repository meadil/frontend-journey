        <h1>Jeff Bezos: From <i>Garage Startup</i> to <mark><em>E-Commerce Empire</em></mark></h1>

        <p>Jeff Bezos is one of the most <em>influential</em> entrepreneurs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he would go on to create Amazon, the company that <em>revolutionized</em> online shopping and changed retail <em>forever.</em></p>


        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>

        <p>Bezos showed entrepreneurial spirit from a <em>young age.</em> As a <em>teenager</em>, he started his <strong>first business, the Dream Institute, an educational summer camp for students.</strong> He graduated as valedictorian from his high school and went on to study computer science and electrical engineering at Princeton University.</p>

        <p>After graduating in 1986, Bezos worked on Wall Street in the computer science field. He quickly climbed the ranks and became the youngest senior vice president at the investment firm D.E. Shaw and Company at just 30 years old.</p>


        <h2>The Birth of Amazon</h2>

        <p>In 1994, Bezos made a life-changing decision. After learning that internet usage was growing at <strong>2,300 percent</strong> per year, <em>he saw an enormous opportunity.</em> He quit his high-paying Wall Street job and moved to Seattle to start an <em>online bookstore.</em></p>

        <p>Working from his garage, Bezos launched Amazon.com on July 16, 1995. The name "Amazon" was chosen because it started with "A" (appearing early in alphabetical listings) and referenced the massive Amazon River, symbolizing his vision to make it the world's largest store.</p>

        <p>In its first month, <mark>Amazon sold books to customers in all 50 US states and 45 countries around the world.</mark> The company went public in 1997 at <strong>18 dollars</strong> per share. Today, that same share would be worth thousands of dollars due to stock splits and growth.</p>


        <h2>Building an Empire</h2>

        <p>Bezos didn't stop at books. Amazon expanded into music, movies, electronics, and eventually almost everything you can imagine. The company introduced Amazon Prime in 2005, offering two-day shipping for an annual fee. This changed customer expectations for online shopping forever.</p>

        <p>Amazon Web Services launched in 2006, providing cloud computing services that now power much of the internet. Companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and NASA use AWS infrastructure.</p>

        <p>The company also revolutionized reading with the Kindle e-reader in 2007, and entered the voice assistant market with Alexa in 2014. <mark>Amazon's market value grew to over <strong>1 trillion dollars</strong></mark>, making it one of the most valuable companies in history.</p>


        <h2>Beyond Amazon</h2>

        <p>Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, a space exploration company with the goal of making space travel accessible to everyone. On July 20, 2021, Bezos flew to space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket, fulfilling a lifelong dream.</p>

        <p>In 2013, Bezos purchased The Washington Post newspaper for <strong>250 million dollars</strong>, helping to transform it into a major digital news platform.</p>


        <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>

        <p>Bezos is known for his customer-obsessed approach to business. His famous quote is: <mark><em>"We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better."</em></mark></p>

        <p>He implemented the "two-pizza rule" at Amazon - <em>teams should be small enough to be fed by two pizzas</em>. This keeps teams <em>nimble</em> and <em>efficient</em>.</p>


        <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>

        <p>In 2021, Bezos <em>stepped down</em> as CEO of Amazon to focus on other ventures, though he remains executive chairman. Under his leadership, Amazon grew from a garage startup to employing over <strong>1.5 million people</strong> worldwide.</p>

        <p>Love him or hate him, Jeff Bezos fundamentally changed how the world shops, reads, and uses technology. His story shows how a bold idea, relentless focus on customers, and willingness to think long-term can build something extraordinary.</p>
