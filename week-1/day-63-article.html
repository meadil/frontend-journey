        <h1>The Chemistry of Water</h1>

        <p>Water is one of <em>the most important</em> substances on Earth. Its chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O, meaning each molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bonded together.</p>


        <h2>Why Water is Special</h2>

        <p>Water covers approximately <strong>71% of Earth's surface.</strong> Without it, life as we know it would not <em>exist</em>. <mark>The human body is about 60% water</mark>, making it <strong>essential for survival.</strong></p>


        <h2>The Science Behind It</h2>

        <p>Water's unique properties come from its molecular structure. The bond angle between the hydrogen atoms is approximately 104.5 degrees. This creates a polar molecule, which is why water is such a good solvent.</p>

        <p>When water freezes, it expands. This is unusual because most substances contract when they freeze. Ice has a density of about 0.92 grams per cubic centimeter, while liquid water has a density of 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.</p>


        <h2>Water in Chemical Reactions</h2>

        <p>Water plays a crucial role in many chemical reactions. For example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In photosynthesis, plants use water: 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O produces <strong>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></strong></li>
            <li>Water can split into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis: 2H<sub>2</sub>O produces 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub></li>
            <li><em>Never</em> mix water with concentrated sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) <em>directly</em> - <strong>it can cause a violent reaction and release dangerous heat</strong></li>
        </ul>

        
        <h2>Energy and Water</h2>

        <p>The energy required to heat water is significant. To raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius requires 4.18 joules of energy. This is why water is used in cooling systems.</p>

        <p><mark>Einstein's famous equation E=mc<sup>2</sup> applies even to water molecules.</mark> The mass of a water molecule is approximately 2.99 x 10<sup>-26</sup> kilograms.</p>


        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Water's chemical properties make it unique and irreplaceable. From its molecular formula H<sub>2</sub>O to its role in sustaining life, water continues to be one of the most studied substances in science.</p>
