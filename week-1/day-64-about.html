        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I'm a self-taught developer on a mission to build real solutions for real problems.</p>

        <p>Started my journey in 2024 with 60 days of JavaScript fundamentals. Learned variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects, and problem-solving from the ground up. Now I'm in Phase 2 - mastering HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation.</p>

        <p>The goal? Become freelance-ready by the end of 2026. Big dreams, daily grind.</p>

        <p>I believe in learning by building. Every day I code, commit to GitHub, and push forward. The green squares don't lie.</p>
